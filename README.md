## Overview
This is a **reusable project tracking template** designed to improve organization, visibility, and efficiency in managing tasks and projects.
It can be used for planning, tracking progress, and documenting projects in a structured way.

The template is built with placeholders to allow easy reuse across multiple projects.

- **Task Tracking Table:** Task ID, Task Description, Owner, Due Date, Status, Notes
- **Placeholders:** Makes the template flexible for any project
- **Reusable Structure:** Can be copied and used for multiple projects

## Instructions
